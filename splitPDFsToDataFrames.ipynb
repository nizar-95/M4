      "Introduction: ['Online labor marketplaces have grown rapidly in rec ent years. The industry has experienced a great \\nincrease in both the number of participants and tra nsaction volume. Over the last four years, workers on \\nElance and oDesk have earned close to $2 billion th rough over 8 million jobs posted on these online \\nplatforms. 1 On oDesk alone, the number of employers billing on  the site has increased by over 800% \\nbetween 2009 and 2013, accounting for almost a 900%  gain in quarterly wage bill (Agrawal et al. 2013).  \\nNot only do these online platforms serve as an inte rmediary for the buyers and providers of labor, the y \\nalso host a myriad of jobs ranging from software an d web development to administrative support and \\nmultimedia design, which in turn, attracts and reta ins a large pool of global workers. It is projected  that \\nonline labor marketplaces will grow to a $5 billion  industry by 2018. 2 Given the enormous scale of the \\nonline labor market, hiring decisions made by onlin e employers have significant social and economic \\nconsequences, as these actions implicate the income s of millions of workers worldwide. In particular, it is \\nimperative to understand whether online workers are  being treated fairly in terms of job opportunities  \\nawarded and how discriminatory biases, if any, affe ct the hiring decisions made by online employers. \\nJob discrimination pertains to the phenomenon where  groups of workers are denied access, or have \\nlimited access to jobs. Workers can be discriminate d based on innate attributes such as gender, race, \\ndisability or age that are unrelated to worker prod uctivity (Arrow 1973). Discriminatory hiring is an issue \\nof concern not only because it results in the ineff icient allocation of resources, it also contributes  to \\ninequitable distribution of wealth and income among  the population. As such, regulations and legislati ons \\nsuch as the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (US) and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975  (UK) are erected to \\nprevent market failures that arise from discriminat ory labor practices. While governmental interventio ns \\nare in place to protect against unfair treatment of  workers in traditional labor markets, these laws l apse in \\ntheir coverage for online platforms due to the cros sOnational nature of working relationships forged i n \\nthese marketplaces. Greater awareness and better un derstanding of the hiring practices in online labor  \\nmarkets is a necessary first step for deriving effe ctive policy interventions to address the inadequac ies of \\nexisting antiOdiscriminatory laws. \\nWhile extant studies on online labor markets have f ocused on the reputational signals (Lin and Goes 20 12; \\nYoganarasimhan 2013), geographical differences (Agr awal et al. 2012; Hong and Pavlou 2012), and \\nbidding strategies (Hong et al. 2013; Snir and Hitt  2003) of workers, we attempt to examine a more \\nfundamental aspect of worker characteristics in thi s nascent labor marketplace. In particular, we aim to \\nassess whether worker’s gender can lead to hiring b iases, and how gender stereotypes can affect the hi ring \\ndecisions in online labor markets. Gender stereotyp es create a predisposition towards negativity that \\nprecludes the recognition of a worker’s skill and a bility. The importance of gender stereotypes on hir ingO\\nrelated outcomes has led academics from diverse fie lds including economics, psychology, management, \\nand sociology to examine its antecedents and conseq uences (e.g., Darity and Mason 1998; Gorman 2005; \\nIbarra 1992; Olian et al. 1988; Swim et al., 1989).  In addition, the study of gender biases in online labor \\nplatforms is particularly crucial for understanding  whether the presence of such stereotypes would \\neliminate the very benefits that online labor marke ts bring to workers who are disadvantaged due to \\ngenderOrelated discrimination in offline settings. 3  \\nIn the present study, we focus on examining the imp act of workers’ gender on hiring outcomes in one of  \\nthe largest online labor marketplaces. The unusuall y rich dataset from the online platform allows us t o \\nobserve all attributes that employers see in the jo b applicants’ profiles. Thus, the threat of omitted  \\n                                                             \\n1 Figures represent information through September 201 3.

For instances of these cases, see http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/877000.shtml  and \\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9871623/IOwasOreject edOforOjobObecauseOIOwasOpregnantOsaysOlawyerOsuingO\\nfirm.html . Hiring Biases in Online Labor Markets \\nThirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 3 variable bias is greatly reduced in our estimation as our models are able to account for all observabl e \\nworker characteristics that hirers take into consid eration when making hiring decisions. Moreover, we \\nhave multiple observations across job categories an d employers, allowing us to account for heterogeneo us \\nhiring preferences in our estimations. Using highly  detailed observations of worker and job characteri stics, \\nwe first assess the effects of gender identity on h iring outcomes using a matched sample approach. To \\nfurther account for potential endogeneity issues, w e deploy a quasiOexperiment design to validate the \\nrelationship between workers’ gender and their like lihood of being hired. Contrary to expectations in \\ntraditional labor studies, results from various mod el specifications indicate that online hiring bias tends to \\nact in favor of female workers in general. Several additional tests are used to assess the robustness of the \\nresults. We further investigate the moderating effe ct of platformOspecific experience on hiring bias.  \\nOur study aims to make a few contributions to the l iterature. First, this paper contributes broadly to  the \\nliterature related to the social and economic impli cations of online platforms (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. \\n2003; Chan and Ghose 2014; Zhang and Liu 2012) by s hedding light on whether hiring biases prevail in \\nonline labor markets. The awareness of stereotyping  behavior in online hiring decisions allows policy \\nmakers and platform owners to gain macroOlevel insi ghts towards the need for specialized policies and \\nguidelines to regulate these online markets.  \\nSecond, by demonstrating the nature of gender stere otypes in online markets, our study illustrates the  \\nimportant point of whether outcomes in online conte xts are consistent with that from the traditional \\nmarketplaces (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000; Ch ellappa et al. 2011). Not only does this finding ha ve \\ncrucial implications towards policy design, it also  serves to benefit managers and employers at the mi croO\\nlevel by providing managerial inputs that inform th em of the peculiar biases that can potentially affe ct \\ntheir hiring decisions in online environments. Like wise, workers from the disadvantaged group may gain  \\nfrom the study findings by taking steps to rectify the undue biases that are imposed on them in online  \\nsettings.  \\nThird, we attempt to provide deeper insights into t his phenomenon by unraveling the specific condition s \\nunder which gender stereotypes will have a stronger  impact on hiring outcomes. The moderating effect o f \\nplatformOspecific experience provides inroads for a cademics in understanding the potential mechanism \\nthat underlie the decision making process in uncert ain environments (Lipshitz and Strauss 1997; Simon \\n1979). Furthermore, by pinpointing the conditions u nder which hiring biases are most acute, various \\nstakeholders of the online labor marketplaces can m ake appropriate adjustments to mollify the potentia l \\nmarket inefficiencies.  \\nFinally, we make a potential methodological contrib ution to the labor discrimination literature by \\nintroducing a quasiOexperiment approach in the onli ne context to identify the effect of stereotypes on  \\nhiring outcomes. Past work has largely relied on au dit and correspondence studies to examine the exten t \\nof hiring bias (Riach and Rich 2002). While these m ethods may perform well in identifying the causal \\nimpact of stereotypes on hiring outcomes, they are generally expensive, time consuming, and tedious to  \\nexecute. Consequently, implementation of these fiel d experiments is restricted to few specific jobs \\nopenings at one time, affecting the external validi ty of such approaches. Using quasiOexperimental \\napproaches to study hiring biases on large number o f online hiring outcomes is not only less tedious t o \\nexecute, it also provides the opportunity to examin e the effect of stereotyping across multiple job \\ncategories and openings. Furthermore, the quasiOexp erimental approach along with the full set of worke r \\ncovariates observed from the online platform produc es estimation results that are similar or better th an \\nthat achieved in field experiments.   \\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In  the following section, we provide a review of the \\nliteratures relevant to online labor markets, occup ational discrimination and gender stereotypes. Next , we \\ndescribe the context of our study and our data, whi le formulating econometric models to assess the imp act \\nof gender identity on hiring outcomes in the subseq uent section. Following that, we present the main \\nresults of our model estimations as well as further  evaluations of the role of gender stereotyping on hiring \\nlikelihood. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results and their implications for various \\nstakeholders. \\n']\n",
      "Literature Review: ['Online labor marketplaces differ from the tradition al counterpart in several important aspects. First,  the \\nglobal reach of online platforms provides a larger set of choices than is generally available in the o ffline Economics and Value of IS \\n \\n4 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 markets (Brynjolfsson et al. 2003), thereby allowin g employers to access a larger pool of workers than  \\nbefore. The flexibility and freedom afforded by Int ernet telecommunications can also induce individual s \\nwho are previously out of the labor market to parti cipate through this online marketplace (Dettling 20 13). \\nAs such, the increased access and diversity of choi ces may contribute positively towards lower search costs \\nand better matching efficiency in online markets (A utor 2001; Overby and Jap 2009). Second, online \\ncommunications facilitated by the platform eliminat e the need for employers and workers to meet faceOt oO\\nface during the job recruitment and fulfillment pha ses. While online communications may have ushered \\nin greater convenience and accessibility, it can al so exacerbate information asymmetry issues that \\nunderlie the job hiring process (Akerlof 1979; Hort on 2010). Third, jobs posted on online labor market s \\nare largely short term contracts. The transient wor king relationships formed in online labor markets a re \\nneither governed by career advancement incentives n or employee benefits requirements, which \\nconsequently leads to incentive misalignment issues  that can intensify principalOagent problems. \\nTherefore, the trustworthiness of the involved part ies are more important in online markets than in \\noffline ones (Bakos 1997; Pavlou and Gefen 2004). \\nGiven the critical differences that online platform s possess, it is unclear whether hiring outcomes in  \\nonline labor markets would follow the expectations from traditional markets. On the one hand, the \\nenhanced matching efficiency of online platforms co upled with the comprehensive listing of standardize d \\nworker information (e.g., online ratings, number of  past jobs, and wage rate) can reduce the amount of  \\nuncertainty inherent in the hiring process (cf. Bak os 1997; Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000), by allowing \\nemployers to locate appropriate candidates and prof iciently comparing them on common measures of \\nability and credentials. This in turn eliminates th e need for employers to rely on heuristics that are  based \\non workers’ physical traits when making hiring deci sions. On the other hand, the lack of nonOverbal cu es \\nin online communications may exacerbate information  asymmetry issues in the hiring process (Akerlof \\n1979; Dennis et al. 2008; Horton 2010). Given that subtle personal information such as work attitudes \\nand professionalism are less readily available in t he online environment, the reliance on gender \\nstereotypes in making hiring decisions may be more prevalent online (Terborg 1977). The theoretical \\ntension therein produces an ambiguous understanding  of the uncertainty faced by employers as a result of \\nthe affordances in the online labor platform.   \\nPast studies on online labor markets have indirectl y demonstrated this theoretical tension. Using \\nElance.com data, Banker and Hwang (2008) show that measures of past worker performance, such as \\nonline ratings and cumulative earnings, hold positi ve relationships with the worker’s probability of b eing \\nhired. Hong and Pavlou (2012) also find that platfo rm measures such as feedback rating, number of \\ncompleted projects, gold member status, and project  completion rates can positively influence employer ’s \\nhiring decisions on Freelancer.com. These results d emonstrate that the informational affordances of \\nplatform can help reduce uncertainty in online labo r markets. Not only do employers utilize the \\ninformational features in the online marketplaces, they exhibit strong reactions to these affordances.  For \\ninstance, by randomly hiring and providing feedback  to oDesk workers, Pallais (2014) demonstrates that  \\neven minimal amount of positive information can hel p to increase a worker’s future earnings drasticall y. \\nStanton and Thomas (2012) find that inexperienced w orkers affiliated with an agency have substantially  \\nhigher jobOfinding probabilities at the beginning o f their careers on oDesk. The heavy reliance on the se \\ninformational features suggests that employers are faced with high levels of uncertainty in the hiring  \\nprocess due to acute information asymmetry issues t hat are inherent in the online context.  \\nThe ambiguous effect on hiring uncertainty in onlin e settings produces an unclear understanding on \\nwhether gender stereotypes are involved in hiring d ecisions. In the case where hiring biases are indee d \\npresent, a followOup question is how gender stereot ypes would affect hiring outcomes in online \\nenvironment. While there is a long history of liter ature delineating the impact of discriminatory hiri ng in \\ntraditional labor contexts, the existing theory and  evidence on the effect of gender stereotyping in o nline \\nenvironments are largely nonOexistent. We discuss t he various streams of literatures pertinent to our \\nstudy context next. \\nOccupational Discrimination \\nScholars have identified two types of occupational discrimination at work. In statistical discriminati on, \\nthe difference in the treatment of men and women ar ise from the expectation that these two groups have  \\ndifferent levels of productivity (Phelps 1972 ; Arrow 1973). In contrast, tasteObased discriminati on stems Hiring Biases in Online Labor Markets \\nThirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 5 from an animus towards one group (Becker 1957). Tho ugh it is hard to distinguish between the two types  \\nof discrimination, several studies have consistentl y demonstrated that gender discrimination holds a \\nsignificant impact on hiring outcomes.  \\nUnder the audit study method, researchers use match ed pairs of individuals of different gender to \\nmasquerade as job hunters to solicit for hiring res ponses. Using this method, Neumark et al. (1996) an d \\nGoldin and Rouse (1997) found that women faced hiri ng discrimination at highOprice restaurants and \\nsymphony orchestras, respectively. In correspondenc e studies, pairs of fake resumes with similar \\ncharacteristics but with different names signaling disparate gender are sent to job evaluators. Result s \\nfrom some correspondence studies revealed that fema le candidates are universally discriminated against  \\n(e.g., Riach and Rich 1987), while others found sup port for occupational segregation, a situation wher e \\nhirers prefer hiring male workers for masculine job s and female workers for feminine jobs (e.g., Booth  \\nand Leigh 2010; Glick et al. 1988; Jawahar and Matt sson 2005). Under a separate study technique of \\ntracing applicants’ referral network, Fernandez and Sosa (2005) find that female applican ts are in fact \\nfavored over males for an entryOlevel customer serv ice job at a large bank.  The lack of consensus across \\nstudy findings in traditional labor markets suggest s that the process of occupational discrimination i s a \\ncomplicated one that has varying effects on hiring decisions, and is temporally and contextually \\ndependent.  \\nGender Differences \\nIt is well recognized that males differ from female s in various aspects. Women are generally perceived  as \\nwarm, gentle and kind, whereas men are viewed as to ugh and aggressive (Huddy and Terkildsen 1993). \\nStudies have also shown that women are being seen a s more trustworthy, helpful, reciprocal and altruis tic \\nthan men (Andreoni and Petrie 2008; Buchan et al. 2 008; Eckel and Grossman 1998; Orbell et al. 1994). \\nThese perceptual gender differences are found to ma nifest as differential treatment of males and femal es \\nin situations that involve trusting strangers. Evid ence of such has been reported in the online peerOt oOpeer \\ncredit markets, among others. For instance, Ravina (2008) found that female borrowers were rated as \\nmore trustworthy and were more likely to get loans than male borrowers. Similarly, Pope and Sydnor \\n(2009) revealed that female borrowers have a higher  likelihood of being funded and received lower \\ninterest rates on loans compared to their male coun terparts. As such, perceptions of gender difference s \\ncan play important roles in affecting hiring outcom es, particularly in contexts where trust is a cruci al \\nenabling factor in relations where there is uncerta inty and fear of opportunism (Gefen et al. 2003; Ma yer \\net al. 1995). \\nFrom a social role perspective, men are expected to  demonstrate independence from others through \\nsuccessful individual performances, while women are  seen to be more communally oriented which \\nmanifests through behaviors of interpersonal cooper ation, relationship formation and maintenance \\n(Tannen 1990). At the same time, men are attracted to competition, while women are inclined to avoid \\ncompetitive situations (Gneezy et al. 2003; Niederl e and Vesterlund 2007). Taken jointly, these gender  \\ntraits explain why women avoid negotiation situatio ns, and are more likely to accept lower offers than  \\nmen (Babcock and Laschever 2003; Eckel and Grossman  2001; Kray et al. 2002). This gender difference \\nis pertinent to employment situations as aggressive  negotiation styles are found to affect the likelih ood \\nwith which agreements are reached (Hamner 1974). \\nData \\nTo address our research questions related to online  hiring biases, we use a novel proprietary dataset from \\na large online labor market which consists of highl y detailed job posting information between August \\n2012 and December 2013. 4 We limit our study sample to jobs that are filled with one hired applicant, so \\nthat definite hiring outcomes can be observed. We f ocus our analyses on hiring outcomes for jobs that are \\npaid hourly as opposed to those paid on the basis o f fixed prices to abstract from the differences in project \\nsizes and durations. Job applications from India, B angladesh, Philippines, Pakistan, and United States  \\nrepresent over 85% of all applications on the platf orm. We further restrict our dataset to job applica tions \\nfrom these top five countries so that results would  be free from the influence of outlier effects. Bas ed on \\n                                                             \\n4 Based on a nonOdisclosure agreement, we are not all owed to disclose the identity of the online labor p latform. Economics and Value of IS \\n \\n6 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 the screening steps, our resultant dataset contains  a total of 194,596 job postings. \\nFor each job application, we have information on wh ether the contractor has been previously hired by t he \\ncurrent employer who posted the job, the job catego ry, whether the employer invited the worker to send  a \\njob application, and the hourly wage proposed by th e worker. On top of the jobOspecific information, w e \\nalso have a rich set of worker attributes including  first and last name, worker type (i.e., independen t or \\nagency contractor), English proficiency, country of  residence, education attainment, employment histor y, \\noverall feedback score, number of portfolio items, number of certifications obtained, number of tests \\npassed, number of jobs completed, and whether a pro file photo is posted. Among these worker attributes , \\nsome of the worker’s credentials are selfOreported,  while others are verified by the platform. The key  \\noutcome variable in this study is whether a worker is hired. \\nGender Inference \\nIn preventing discriminatory behaviors and privacy breaches, the platform does not collect demographic  \\ninformation such as age, gender, race, and religion  from its workers. Despite this precautionary step,  \\nemployers are likely able to infer the gender ident ity of workers from either their names and/or profi le \\nphotos. We make a similar inference of the worker’s  gender through the application of machineOlearning  \\napproaches on the names and photos found on workers ’ profiles. \\nThe platform requires all workers to use real and v erifiable first names on their profiles. Several st udies \\ndemonstrated the possibility of inferring gender id entity from first names (e.g., Gallagher and Chen 2 008). \\nIn particular, Tang et al. (2011) constructed a com prehensive list of first names with annotated gende r \\nprobabilities based on data from public Facebook pr ofile pages of 1.67 million users. Using the nameO\\ngender probability estimates from Tang et al. (2011 ), we match the worker’s name in our sample to that  in \\nthe list, and inferred the worker’s gender using a cutoff confidence value of 95%. In cases where the \\nprobability is less than 95%, we label the gender o f the worker as unknown.  \\nFurthermore, a large proportion of workers (85.88%)  in our dataset posted a photo on their profile pag e. \\nCompared to names, photos convey more direct and sa lient information about one’s gender. Advances in \\nthe computer vision and machine learning have produ ced mature techniques for the automatic extraction \\nof facial features such as pupilOtoOnose vertical d istance, chin radii, eyebrow thickness, and hair fo r gender \\nprediction (e.g., Gutta et al. 1998; Yang et al. 20 06; Gao and Ai 2009). We developed a programming \\nscript that makes use of a facial recognition packa ge to perform gender classification on profile phot os of \\nworkers in our dataset. 5 A minimum accuracy of 95% confidence was imposed o n the facial recognition \\nexercise.  \\n \\nTable 1.

The estimation of the gender  identity parameter ( /g2009) is our \\nprimary concern. Utility ( /g1873/g3036/g3037 ) is an unobserved latent variable that is revealed  through an employer’s \\nchoice of worker /g1862 for a particular job posting /g1861. A repeated cross sectional dataset at the job lev el is used \\nfor this analysis, in which applications for each j ob form multiple observations for each unit of anal ysis. It \\nshould be noted that job related characteristics ar e not used in this specification as the jobOlevel f ixed \\neffects are in place. NonOgender attributes ( /g1876/g3037) include the worker characteristics listed in Tabl e 1. \\nThough a complete set of observable worker attribut es along with unobserved heterogeneity job effects \\nare accounted for in the conditional logit model, e ndogeneity issues may still exist in the estimation  of \\ngender effects on hiring outcome. As observed from past studies on labor discrimination, a potential \\nsource of endogeneity may arise from selection effe cts, which involve systematic differences in both \\nobserved and unobserved abilities of male and femal e applicants for each job (Pager et al. 2009; Riach  \\nand Rich 2002). Ideally in our analyses, we would l ike each job candidate to be contrasted with a \\ncomparable individual of the opposite gender such t hat hiring outcomes are not driven by differences i n \\nworkers’ ability but by their gender identity. Whil e it is impossible to find perfect counterfactuals in field \\nsettings or to control for all ability differences using observable traits, we are able to mitigate th is source \\nof endogeneity by employing a matched sampling appr oach. A propensity score matching strategy is used \\nto find the closest match for every female applican t in the dataset to derive a sample of job applican ts with \\ncomparable counterparts of the opposite gender. The  matching exercise also helps to remove job posting s \\nthat do not contain comparable applicants from both  genders, thereby reducing estimation biases \\ngenerated by postings that have exceptional strong (weak) candidates that have very high (low) \\nprobability of being hired. \\nTo further rule out concerns on endogeneity, we emp loy a quasiOexperiment technique to address \\npotential estimation biases that arise from unobser ved differences in workers’ ability levels. Having access \\nto rich observations of a large number of worker pr ofiles over time, we are able to isolate a pool of workers \\nwhose gender identities are unclear to hirers. We a chieve that by identifying workers whose names are \\nuncommon and are not informative of gender identity . As a default, we define uncommon names to be \\nthose that appeared ten times or less in the annota ted name list that was used to identify worker’s \\ngender. 6 Among these genderOanonymous workers, we further i dentify a subOpopulation of workers who \\ndid not have a profile photo at the beginning of th e study period but have added a photo to their prof ile \\nbefore the end of the study period. We restrict the  timeframe of consideration to 1.5 years so that an y \\nchanges in workers’ abilities and qualifications wi ll be minimal.  \\nBased on the selection criteria, the resultant data set comprises of a panel of workers whose gender \\nidentities are ambiguous initially but are clarifie d later via the information conveyed in their poste d \\nprofile photos. By comparing the hiring outcomes of  each worker before and after the posting of photos , \\nwe are able to identify the impact of gender on hir ing likelihood. This identification strategy addres ses \\nestimation issues from differences in workers’ abil ities by having each worker to be his/her own \\ncounterfactual when his/her gender identity is unkn own to hirers.

The parameter for gender ide ntity revealed via posted \\nphoto ( /g2009/g2871) provides us with the effect of the hiring bias wi thin the quasiOexperiment set up. We note that \\nthe gender main effect ( /g2009/g2869) under this specification represents differential ability and quality across \\nworkers of different sex.  \\nIn the specifications above, we examine the overall  hiring probability across all job categories to \\nunderstand whether gender discrimination exists at the aggregate level. To further understand the natu re \\nof gender stereotype that is prevalent in the onlin e setting, we perform subsample analyses by repeati ng \\nour estimations on observations for three specific job categories: femaleOdominated occupations, maleO\\ndominated occupations and genderOneutral occupation s. We rely on two sources of information to classif y \\njobs into each of categories. First, we tabulate th e proportion of male to female applicants for each job \\ncategory and determine if they fall above or below the average maleOfemale ratio of workers on the \\nplatform. Second, we rely on the occupation gender composition information provided by the Bureau of \\nLabor Statistics (BLS; see http://www.bls.gov ) to identify genderOdominated jobs. Under these tw o \\ncategorizations, we find that “Administrative Suppo rt” jobs consistently fall under femaleOdominated \\noccupations; “Software Development” is categorized as maleOdominated occupations; “Design & \\nMultimedia” belongs to genderOneutral occupations. By examining the effect of gender on hiring outcome s \\nacross these job categories, we can assess whether the directionality of the hiring bias is dependent on \\noccupational stereotypes. \\nResults \\nMain results \\nWe present the regression results from Equation 1 i n Table 2. In column 1, we estimate a basic model \\nwhere no matching is used. Columns 2 to 5 show the regression estimates derived under matched samples.  \\nMore specifically in columns 2 and 4, the observati ons are made up of workers who are matched within \\nthe same job category, while those in columns 3 and  5 are obtained by matching workers within each job  \\nposting. Within each job category and posting, we r equire exact matching on employer invitation, \\npreviously hired, and agency contractor, and perfor m propensity score matching on other attributes. Th e \\ncaliper size used is 0.01 in columns 2 and 3, and a  caliper size of 0.001 is used in columns 4 and 5. All \\nmatching is performed without replacement, under co mmon support. A balance check indicated that the \\nstandardized bias after matching is below 5%, sugge sting that the matching process has resulted in a \\nbalanced sample of male and female workers (Caliend o et al. 2008). \\nIn column 1, we see that female variable holds a po sitive coefficient that is significant at the 1% le vel, \\nsuggesting that female workers enjoy a higher likel ihood of getting hired compared to their male \\ncounterparts. The gender estimates under the matche d sample are also positive and significant at the 1 % \\nlevel, thereby affirming the relationship observed in the unmatched sample. That means that after \\naccounting for differences in worker ability via on eOtoOone matching, a hiring bias in favor of female  \\ncandidates is still present. In particular, the str ictest matching strategy (column 5) suggests that t he odds \\nof a female applicant being hired are 21.7% higher than that of a male applicant.  \\nEstimates of the control variables are informative of how various jobOrelated and workerOspecific \\nattributes affect the likelihood of being hired.

This negative main effect  from the Female  variable suggests that male applicants \\nmay have stronger abilities and jobOfit compared to  female candidates. Next, the positive coefficient on \\nthe Photo  variable indicates that all job applicants benefit  from the posting of photos. However, the \\nmagnitude of the benefit differs between the two ge nders in that the odds of being hired increases by 113.8% \\nfor female applicants but only by 22.3% for male ap plicants. Furthermore, the odds of females with \\nphotos being hired are 10.8% higher compared to mal es with photos. Therefore, the revelation of gender  \\ngives a disproportionate advantage to female worker s. \\n \\nTable 3: Estimates under Quasi-Experiment Approach \\n (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \\nFemale O0. 456**  \\n(0.18) O0.495**  \\n(0.21) O0.709 ** \\n(0.33) O0.465**  \\n(0.21) O0.423*  \\n(0.23) \\nHas Photo 0. 201*  \\n(0.11) 0.281**  \\n(0.13) O0.094  \\n(0.20) 0. 305**  \\n(0.14) 0.349**  \\n(0.15) \\nFemale × Has Photo 0.559 ***  \\n(0.20) 0.526**  \\n(0.24) 0.882 ** \\n(0.37) 0.596 **  \\n(0.24) 0.639 **  \\n(0.27) \\nControls /checkbld /checkbld /checkbld /checkbld /checkbld \\nWorker Country Fixed Effects /checkbld /checkbld /checkbld /checkbld /checkbld \\nNo. of Name Occurrences ≤10 ≤ 5 0 ≤ 10 ≤ 10 \\nNo. of Applications with or \\nwithout posted photos ≥ 1 ≥ 1 ≥ 1 ≥ 3 ≥ 5 \\nLog Likelihood O1253.90 O874.96 O407.82 O759.79 O58 8.76 \\nObservations 4672 3216 1537 2744 2128 \\nNo. of Applicants 1293 1002 567 749 573 \\nNotes : All models are conditional logistic regressions w ith job posting fixed effects. * significance at 10 % level, ** \\nsignificance at 5% level and *** significance at 1%  level. \\n \\nTo evaluate the robustness of this result, we repea ted the analysis in column 1 using more stringent \\ncriteria. In columns 2 and 3, we tighten the criter ia of uncommon names by selecting workers whose \\nnames appear five times or less, and did not appear  at all in our annotated list, respectively. Result s in \\ncolumns 2 and 3 show that the interaction term cont inues to hold a positive and significant coefficien t, \\nsignifying that the previous result is robust to st ricter definitions of name commonality. Next, we as sess \\nthe robustness of the result with respect to outlie rs. Within this panel of workers, there are workers  who Economics and Value of IS \\n \\n12 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 posted their photos late (early) resulting in few ( many) instances of job application with exposed gen der \\nidentity. To account for these outliers, we remove applicants who have few job applications with or \\nwithout posted photos. Columns 4 and 5 report the r esults for which the minimum number of \\napplications with or without photos is 3 and 5, res pectively. The regression results derived under the se \\nsamples remain qualitatively similar to that in col umn 1, suggesting that the findings in this quasiO\\nexperiment setup is robust.  \\nNature of gender bias in hiring \\nTo examine the nature of gender bias in our setting , we investigate the hiring outcomes for various jo b \\ncategories on the platform, split by feminine, masc uline and genderOneutral occupations. In Table 4, w e \\nreport the regression results of the samples matche d by job category and job posting, using various \\nmatching criteria.7 The results are consistent across different model specifications for genderOdominated \\noccupations, so we only discuss the effect sizes us ing the first specification. From column 1, we see that \\nthe odds of females being hired are 41.6% higher fo r administrative support positions (i.e., feminine \\noccupation). In addition to that, column 3 shows th at females are 19.1% less likely to get hired in so ftware \\ndevelopment jobs (masculine occupation), in terms o f odds ratio.8 This set of results provides evidence in \\nsupport of occupational segregation in online hirin g decisions, that is, employers prefer hiring femal e \\nworkers for femaleOdominated occupations and male w orkers for maleOdominated occupations.   \\nInterestingly, we note that female workers are more  likely to be hired in jobs posted under the design  and \\nmultimedia category (genderOneutral occupation). Mo re specifically from column 2, we note that the odd s \\nof female workers being hired is 16.4% higher for j obs posted under the design and multimedia category  \\n(genderOneutral occupation). While the coefficients  in columns 2, 5, 8, and 11 are not always signific ant, \\nthe direction of the coefficient is highly consiste nt in showing a positive bias towards female worker s for \\ngenderOneutral jobs.  \\nModerating effect of employer experience \\nIt is plausible that the hiring bias may change ove r time, particularly so when employers gain experie nce \\nin hiring workers on the online platform. To assess  this possibility, we run the conditional logit \\nregressions on different samples of employers, spli t by their hiring experience on the platform. In \\nparticular, we split the sample of employers into u pper and lower quartiles of the number of workers \\nhired.  \\nIn Table 5, we see that the gender coefficients fro m the “low experience” employers are positive and \\nsignificant, while the gender coefficients for “hig h experience” employers are nonOsignificant. This s et of \\nresults indicates that hiring bias mainly exists in  new employers who have few hiring experiences on t he \\nlabor marketplace, and the bias diminishes as emplo yers make more hires on the platform. We also note \\nthat this effect is consistent across different str ingency in matching criteria, suggesting that the o bserved \\ntrend is rather robust.  \\n \\nTable 4: Estimates in Gender-Dominated Job Categori es \\n No Matching  Matched by Job Category,  \\nCaliper Size 0.01  \\nFeminine  Neutral  Masculine  Feminine  Neutral  Masculine  \\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) \\nFemale 0.348***  \\n(0.02) 0.152***  \\n(0.03) O0.212***  \\n(0.08) 0.426***  \\n(0.03) 0.043  \\n(0.04) O0.218  \\n(0.14) \\n                                                             \\n7 Matching workers by job posting under a caliper si ze of 0.001 is not possible, as there are too few m atched \\nobservations, resulting in nonOconvergence in the c onditional logit regression. \\n8 The coefficient in column 6 is marginally signific ant at 13% level. This drop in significance is larg ely due to the \\nreduction in sample size after matching is imposed.

We use a rich set of controls, along  with a matched sample approach to account for \\nendogeneity issues that arise from individual diffe rences across job applicants. We further address \\nestimation biases through the use of a quasiOexperi ment strategy which sets each applicant up as his/h er \\nown counterfactual when his/her gender identity is unknown to hirers. Our results provide evidence for  \\nthe presence of a hiring bias that is in favor of f emale applicants. In addition, our analyses suggest  that \\nemployers are influenced by the perception of sexOt yped jobs, in that they are more likely to hire wom en Economics and Value of IS \\n \\n14 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 for feminine jobs and men for masculine jobs. Femal es are also likely to enjoy a greater hiring likeli hood \\nin genderOneutral jobs. Lastly, our results demonst rate that the hiring bias dissipates with increased  \\nhiring experience on the platform. \\nThis study provides several important insights for academics, policy makers, online platform owners, a nd \\nhiring managers. First, the discovery of a gender b ias in the online hiring decisions is counterintuit ive to \\nour understanding as anonymity is a major defining characteristic of online environments. In online \\ncontexts where personal identities can be easily co ncealed and manipulated, we would expect biases bas ed \\non personal characteristics to be minimal or nonOex istent. Yet, in the effort to promote authenticity and \\ntrust in the online labor marketplace, user provide d information such as real names and photos have th e \\nunintended consequence of facilitating opportunitie s for hiring biases to take place. The presence of a \\ngender bias implies the need to implement policies and regulations in the online labor market to curb \\nsuch unwarranted behaviors. While platform owners s hould still collect real names for identity \\nauthentication, they could consider using pseudonym s or screen names for worker profiles. In addition,  \\nplatform owners should encourage workers to use ava tars and screen names that are not informative of \\nworkers’ demographic characteristics, so that hirin g biases based on stereotypes can be minimized.  \\nSecond, the directionality of the hiring bias demon strates the important point that online mediums can  \\nbring about drastic differences to phenomenon that occur in offline contexts. Though gender occupation al \\nsegregation exists in both offline and online envir onments, the hiring biases in online labor markets tend \\nto manifest as a preference for female workers in g eneral. This trend operates in an opposite fashion to \\nobservations in traditional labor markets where hir ing biases work against female workers. Such an \\noutcome may be surprising to labor economists but i s not unexpected to IS academics, as a multitude of  \\nextant IS studies has consistently show that trust is a crucial factor in enabling relationships and \\ntransactions in online markets (Gefen et al. 2003; Pavlou et al. 2007). As hirers face risks and uncer tainty \\nin the online environment, they are prone to rely o n cues signaling that the applicant is not a bad wo rker \\n(e.g., workers who intentionally delays the duratio n of the project to get larger earnings under the h ourly \\npayment, negotiating project deliverables with empl oyers after the start of the contract, and asking f or \\npayment bonuses prior to starting a project). To th is effect, females gain an advantage from the gener al \\nperception that they are more honest, trustworthy, cooperative, and less inclined to negotiate working  \\nterms with their employers.  \\nWith the aim to provide evidence that the lack of t rust is a potential underlying reason leading to hi ring \\nbias, we examine the moderating effect of employer experience on the relationship between gender \\nstereotype and hiring outcomes. Under this test, we  found that the hiring bias favoring women dissipat es \\nas employers make more hires on the online platform . We theorize that repeated usage of the online \\nmarketplace allows the employer to learn and build up confidence in the efficacy of the institutional \\nmeasures for addressing agency problems (e.g., time  tracker which monitors worker’s actual working \\nhours, online procedures to dispute the work qualit y and charges incurred). After gaining trust in the  \\nonline labor platform, employers’ reliance on inher ent biases to make hiring decisions is likely reduc ed. \\nAs such, the hiring bias in online labor market pre sents an interesting situation for policy makers an d \\nplatform owners, as it is largely motivated by a tr ust inertia inherent in all inexperienced employers . The \\ntraditional strategies used for reducing discrimina tory hiring may not be fully effective in this onli ne \\ncontext. Potential remedies for such bias in online  environments involve platform owners providing \\nassurance to new employers through indicators and m easures of the worker innate qualities such as \\nworker’s timeliness, integrity, attitudes and profe ssionalism. \\nFinally, results in the quasiOexperiment design sug gest that females are hired even when male applican ts \\nare more effective for the posted job. The hiring b ias induced by an unfounded preference for female \\nproduces market inefficiencies for the online labor  market. The gender bias obfuscates and overwhelms \\nthe consideration of applicants’ ability and jobOfi t, which results in the rejection of wellOsuited ca ndidates \\nover lessOqualified applicants. This finding is par ticularly relevant to hiring managers as it serves to \\ninform them of the inherent biases that they may ha ve when making hiring decisions in online \\nmarketplaces. As such, practitioners hiring workers  in online marketplaces should be cautious about \\nmaking hiring decisions based on undue influence fr om stereotypes. Admittedly, this hiring bias might \\narise unintentionally and unwillingly, which is why  platform owners bear the ultimate weight of provid ing \\nrelevant site infrastructure to reduce information asymmetry present in the online context.  \\nOur study is not without limitations, some of which  may serve as research agendas for future studies. First, Hiring Biases in Online Labor Markets \\nThirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 15  our study findings are confined to the observations  from one online labor marketplace. Given that \\ndifferent online labor markets may differ and have peculiar characteristics (i.e., types of job offere d, \\nworker composition, quality assurance mechanisms), it may be plausible that the results on hiring bias  in \\nthis study may not generalize to other online platf orms. However, we are less worried about this as ou r \\nstudy site represents one of the largest labor mark etplaces in the Internet which hosts a significant \\nnumber of active projects and workers. Regardless, future efforts to crossOvalidate our findings will \\nstrengthen the external validity of our study.  \\nSecond, by focusing our study on hiring bias from g ender stereotypes, our study is unable to provide \\ninsights related to biases that arise from other ty pes of discriminative hiring (e.g., racial, age). F uture \\nstudies may want to delve into the equally crucial issue of how other stereotyping perceptions of race  and \\nage may affect hiring outcomes. In particular, the combination of multiple stereotyping traits (i.e., male \\nworkers from India vs. female workers in India, Chi nese male workers from China vs. Chinese male \\nworkers in Indonesia) can prove to hold interesting  and meaningful relationships with hiring outcomes.   \\nThird, a related point to the previous point is tha t this study examines stereotyping behavior from th e \\nperspective of hiring decisions. Labor discriminato ry practices may also exhibit through wage differen tials \\nacross disparate groups of individuals (e.g., Alton ji and Pierret 2001). It is possible that females m ay \\nreceive an advantage in terms of higher hiring like lihood but suffer a penalty in their wages received  in the \\nonline market. Insights into the multiOaspects of l abor discriminatory practices will help decision ma kers \\narrive at holistic interventions and policies to ta ckle stereotyping behaviors in its entirety.  \\nFinally, we reasoned that the overarching preferenc e in hiring female workers lies on the perception t hat \\nwomen are generally seen as more trustworthy and co operative than men. While this trend has received \\nmuch theoretical support from extant studies on per ceptual differences in genders, future research may  \\ncontribute to this literature by providing empirica l validation of this relationship in the online con text via \\nsurveys, interviews and anecdotal evidence. \\nAs online labor marketplaces continues to grow in i ts size and reach, a greater proportion of the worl d’s \\nemployers and workers would be transacting through this online intermediary. Though the benefits of \\nreduced search costs and efficient matching are lar gely welcomed by parties from both the demand and \\nsupply end, the expansion of online labor markets a lso ushers in similar social and economic issues th at \\nare observed in traditional marketplaces. While suc h issues are carefully monitored and regulated in \\noffline markets, these practices have not been thor oughly and widely applied to online labor markets, as \\nthe rise of these intermediaries represents a relat ively nascent phenomenon that has not been fully \\nunderstood. Our study fills this gap by shedding li ght on the prevalence and nature of hiring bias in online \\nlabor markets. The implications for future research  and policy are important, as the understanding of \\nstereotyping behaviors in online contexts is a crit ical first step towards the effective design of gui delines \\nand policies to improve market efficiency and to en force labor equality.  \\nReferences \\nAgrawal, A., Horton, J., Lacetera, N., & Lyons, E.
